A hackathon is a collaborative event, often focused on technology, where diverse teams rapidly develop a working prototype or proof-of-concept for a specific problem or theme within a short timeframe, such as a weekend. Participants, who can be developers, designers, and project managers, aim to innovate, learn new skills, network, and compete for prizes or recognition, often working in a fast-paced, fun, and challenging environment.
